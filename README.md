## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Plotly. The project also includes a Streamlit web application to visualize these algorithms in 3D plots.

## Live Demo

You can view the live version of the web application [here](https://ml-algorithms-from-scratch-lnvbwmqcoy5ds2vzmrbf7w.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- Implementation of machine learning algorithms using only Python and NumPy.
- Interactive 3D visualizations with Plotly.
- A web application built with Streamlit for easy access and demonstration.


## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch.git
cd Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

    
## Usage

You can run the individual scripts to see the implementation of the algorithms, or you can launch the Streamlit web application to interact with the visualizations.

###  Running Individual Scripts
Navigate to the **'models'** directory and run any script to see the algorithm in action.

```bash
cd models
python linear_regression.py
```

### Launching the Web Application
To start the web application, run:

```bash
streamlit run webapp/app.py
```
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to see the application.


## Algorithms Implemented

### Supervised Learning
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naive Bayes
* AdaBoost

### Unsupervised Learning
* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* DBSCAN
* Apriori (Association Rule Learning)
### Deep Learning
* Perceptron (Single-Layer Neural Network)
